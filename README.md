# CreditcardFraudDetection
Project Overview: This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Machine Learning techniques. Given the highly imbalanced dataset, I applied data preprocessing, feature scaling, and oversampling methods to improve fraud detection accuracy.

📊 Technologies Used:
✔ Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib) – For data processing & visualization
✔ Scikit-Learn & Imbalanced-Learn – For ML modeling & handling imbalanced data
✔ XGBoost & Random Forest – For high-accuracy fraud detection
✔ Joblib – To save and reuse the trained model

🎯 Key Results:
✅ Achieved 99.9% accuracy using XGBoost
✅ Balanced dataset using SMOTE oversampling
✅ Reduced False Negatives significantly (only 35 missed fraud cases!)

How to Use This Model
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  git clone https://github.com/reazul1991/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
